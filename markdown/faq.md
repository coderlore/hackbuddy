# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Is it free to attend a meetup? Also, is this group for experienced programmers only?

> Yes, our meetups are free! Anyone can join a meetup, regardless of programming experience. If you’re new, that’s not a big deal — everyone before you started off the same way (one way or another). Don’t feel worried if you don’t understand the topics presented, you can always talk to our volunteers and speakers after a meetup session to get help!

Can I bring the kids? (I am a kid, can I join this group?)

> Yes, kids are welcome! Though our groups tend to be comprised mainly of adults, we always strive to ensure that our content remains PG/Family friendly. Many of our best developers have families, and are beginning to teach their little ones about coding. While this audience skews 18 and up, we do see teenagers and elementary school children in attendance with parents. So if you are under 18, we recommend you come with a parent/guardian figure (teachers are okay too!) so we can get their acceptance if you are to participate in any part of the events. Kids are the future and we believe in helping kids learn to code!

Are you online? Do you Zoom or Google Meet?

> Yes, we are 100% remote! Even though we started in Southern California, we have people from all over the world checking us out and we regularly do meetups via Zoom and / or Google Meet. In addition, we have dozens and dozens of free video content on our Youtube channel, so even if you are not from the area, you can still subscribe to our videos there. You can also talk to us at anytime via our chat channels (Slack and Discord)!

Do you offer workshops? How about bootcamps and / or mentorship?

> Yes we do. We are currently revamping our workshop and mentorship programs, so the best way to stay on top of that is to be sure you are subscribed to our email list.

Hi, I’m new to your community. Can I post announcements to your Slack/Discord, forums, etc to promote my own business, someone else’s business, etc?

> No. Please refrain from posting any announcements from other businesses and groups to our chat servers, forums, social media and any other platform that HackBuddy (JavaScriptLA) owns and operates. This includes any announcements about meetups, livestreams, events, books, videos, jobs, tutoring from other groups and/or businesses (essentially anything non-Hackbuddy, non-JavaScriptLA). You should first contact us via info@javascriptla.net to let us know about your promotion so that it can be approved by our admin team. Not doing so will get your post treated as spam and removed, and repeat offenders will be blocked and prevented from further interacting with our community.

Why do I need to email you to post something? That’s too much work!

> We ask that you first work with us to promote anything (even non-profit stuff) — basically ask our permission before you start marketing to our group. Not doing so will most likely get you removed from the group as we do not like unwarranted solicitation/spam. If you have questions, please email us first before doing any advertising.

How about blog posts, news articles from the web, memes and/or videos from shared video sites like YouTube, Twitch?

> This kind of activity is OKAY with our community. You may share blog posts, videos, etc so long as the post is NOT in direct violation of our Code of Conduct. You also agree that you will NOT sell members of our community products and services from links to make money (e.g. use of affiliate links, clickbait, squeeze pages, etc). If you wish to advertise, please first contact us via info@javascriptla.net. If our moderators find you in violation of our rules, you will be immediately banned from the community (and or reported to local authorities as necessary if your activities were illegal).

I receive emails from HackBuddy, JavaScriptLA. Why do you need to email me?

> We use email primarily to keep a line of communication with our members, especially those interested in upcoming meetups, events, training sessions, books, videos and potential job opportunities. Many of our members ask us to help them get better at programming and to help them find employment. Because of this, we ask them to join the email mailing list.

Can I opt out?

> Yes. If you do not want to be emailed, you can opt-out of our mailing list at anytime. We aren’t even going to hold it against you (in this day of clutter, we understand how you might want less notifications in your inbox and on your cell phone) — so all that said you can still get your updates by following us on our social media platforms as well. However, email is usually our preferred way of reaching out, especially if we decide we aren’t going to be using a particular social media platform at a future date. You can also always get updates by visiting this website and our Blog section.

Do you make money on emails? Why should I support you, meetups should be FREE!!!!

> Meetups are not free. They take a great deal of planning and organization. That costs money. We generally do not charge for meetups however because we think we can recover our costs through sponsorships and advertising. This might change in the future. We will never SPAM you however, nor resell your information. Feel free to opt out if advertising bothers you or you don't want to support our group or sponsors. We hope though that you appreciate our hard work and can support us in some way including purchasing paid content we develop or eventually allowing advertising / sponsor content. Thank you for your business and support, we're here to help you get better -- your purchase helps us fund the business so we can continue to develop the content you need to succeed.

Do you sell my information? How do you use my information with your group? Do you use cookies?

> While we do collect your email information through event signups, we do not sell your emails (or personal information) directly to advertisers/sponsors. Sponsors pay us instead for our meetup presence, and then have the right to collect your information directly from you when you walk in or sign up for their services (either in person or online). As far as cookie tracking, we may occasionally use them to help personalize your experience, but you can always opt out. We do not resell information gathered in cookies - they are only used to give you the better experience when visiting our website. Your personal information will NEVER be shared online (DOXXING), and we are always here to help you keep safe. Information about our members is kept offline or on servers that are not publicly accessible and have strong security standards in place.

I see you take pictures and video of members at your meetups. Can I not be in a photo/video or can you please remove me from photo/video?

> Sure. No problem. That said, we always let everyone know each meetup or online meeting that they will be probably photographed or filmed before they RSVP. By actively RSVPing and participating in our events, members give us permission to photograph / film for marketing purposes. We will never DIRECTLY take a picture of you without your permission, however if we are filming an event and you are in attendance as a participant, you may see yourself on film/photography. If you still want to be removed, let us know by email via info@javascriptla.net and we will find a way to help you out. Thank you for your understanding and support!
