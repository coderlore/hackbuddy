We are looking for volunteers to help with organizing and coordinating events and meetups, especially for paired programming events via [Team Hack](https://teamhack.org).

## Do I Need To Know How To Code?

Many volunteers who have helped our group have gone on to land jobs at top companies - so it's well worth the experience to jump in and help out, even if you are still learning the basics.

### Here Are Some Prerequisites

- HTML & CSS, UI/UX Design tools (Photoshop, Figma)
- Github (can make a pull request)
- Ability to learn, improve and take feedback consistently
- Basic understanding of vanilla JavaScript (e.g. functional programming)
- Basic understanding of a classical language (e.g. Python, Java), OOP
- ES6 knowledge (desired)
- React knowledge (desired)
- NPM, Express or Next.js knowledge (desired)
- Exposure to Kanban or SCRUM style planning

> Breathe: You can learn this stuff with us, if you don't know it yet.

## Anything for Me?

Yup, every volunteer gets a T-shirt, stickers, discounts to HackBuddy events, as well as mentored training from the team members including Vijay, that can help you land the job of your dreams!

## We look forward to your application!
