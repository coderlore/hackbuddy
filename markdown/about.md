## About HackBuddy Meetups

Originally JavaScriptLA Meetup from Los Angeles and Orange County in Southern California, we started out with humble beginnings holding meetups at corporate offices.

Eventually we started having meetups with over 100 people in attendance at any given time, which attracted some of the biggest names in the industry including **Google, MongoDB, Disney, General Assembly, Farmers Insurance, Tinder, O'Reilly, FreeCodeCamp** and more.

Around 2020, given Covid-19, we decided to go 100% Remote for the safety of our members. In addition, we felt that remote made more sense moving forward, as the economic landscape post Covid has changed greatly with many of our core audience members seeking jobs across the world.

Finally, given HackBuddy's own goal of expansion - we looked at the chance to be 100% remote as good practice for engineering in itself to operate for large scale audiences. Now you can **join in from anywhere via your favorite remote tools, including Zoom, Github, Discord and Google Meets.**
