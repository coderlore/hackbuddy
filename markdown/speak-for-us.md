# Speak For Us

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/javascriptla.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/speak-for-us.jpg?w=1680&ssl=1" />

We’re always looking for people to speak with our group. You don’t necessarily have to be an “expert” at programming, we love hearing from people at all walks of the journey (whether that be starting out as a beginner to making applications and websites with various frameworks to practicing for your next “TED” talk).

Use our group to platform yourself and build your own name, self worth and credibility. This is really the big appeal of becoming a speaker. Plenty of our past speakers and members have given talks while being somewhat junior or mid-level in their career to basically go on later to work at Fortune 500 companies. And hey — if you’re already somewhat of a bigshot, that’s still okay — giving back to the community is just as fulfilling too!

The only real requirement is that you have some courage to speak in front of others. (By the way we can help you with courage and speaking in front of others, so why not give public speaking a try?)

## What sort of topics can I talk about?

This is totally up to you. We’d love to hear what you are working on, and how many hours you spent on XYZ project / curriculum / homework assignment / app on an iTunes/Android store, whatever. That said we can give you some ideas related to trends we see happening in our industry. Jump on our Discord to speak to us and get some ideas.

## HackBuddy is in Los Angeles / Orange County – but I live outside that area.

We are 100% Remote as of 2020. All presentations are now recorded via Zoom (or similar remote meeting technology). So you don't have to worry about leaving your home or office to speak at our group. Feel free to reach out to us further if you have questions, via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net).

## I want to sell stuff too, is that okay? I provide workshops, books, videos, trainings, recruiting, etc.

Yes that’s perfectly fine, and many speakers and companies work with our group to promote their side hustles / big businesses. There are many ways to work with us, including sponsoring the group for ability to promote, as well as becoming an affiliate to our network, and / or even just drafting up your own terms on how you’d like to work with us and negotiating with our team. (How many other businesses can you work with that offer you that kind of flexibility?) .

Please note, you must first ask us for permission before you can start selling anything with our community. If not sure, please send an email to [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net) and ask us about promoting before you do so within our community (even if you worked with us previously, and definitely if you’ve never talked to our admin team before). Not doing so will have your post treated as spam and prevent you from doing further business with us. Thank you for your understanding!
