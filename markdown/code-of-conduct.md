# Code of Conduct

## PURPOSE

HackBuddy (aka JavaScriptLA) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community and learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We expect all attendees to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout HackBuddy classes and events. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any HackBuddy event. HackBuddy participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from our events or online discussion boards without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.

## HARASSMENT

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, internet or real life trolling, comments related to sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## PRIVACY CONCERNS

Your privacy is important to us. While photographs may be taken online or at in person meetings and can be shared by group members in the group’s meetup page, no photograph shall be used for promotional purposes without verbal and/or written consent of the attendees. If a group photograph is taken, your participation will serve as your agreement to the use of such a photograph for HackBuddy promotional purposes. If you are uncomfortable having your photograph shared, please let us know via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net).

## USE OF SEXUALIZED IMAGERY

Teachers, event organizers, volunteers, and hosts are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, teachers/hosts/organizers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Our organizers, teachers, teacher’s assistants, and event hosts (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized/hostile environment while conducting training / public speaking / hosting a meetup and/or a workshop.

## CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the HackBuddy organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the class/event/meetup group [with no refund].

## WHAT TO DO IF YOU WITNESS OR ARE SUBJECT TO UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact some of our organizers immediately. Contact us via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net)

HackBuddy Teachers & Event Organizers will be happy to help members contact local law enforcement, provide escorts when possible and with reasonable notice, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event/class. We value your attendance.
HackBuddy expects participants to follow these rules at all HackBuddy social events and in online discourse.
