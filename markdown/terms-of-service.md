## Disputes

DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.

Disputes. The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and JavaScriptLA, LLC.

For the purposes of this Section, “Dispute” shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and JavaScriptLA, LLC arising under or relating to any JavaScriptLA, LLC Services, HackBuddy or JavaScriptLA LLC’s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and JavaScriptLA, LLC, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.

YOU AND JavaScriptLA, LLC AGREE THAT “DISPUTE” AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR JavaScriptLA, LLC FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, shall decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.

You and HackBuddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) in the U.S. and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.

ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. The arbitrator may award you the same damages and relief as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.

Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state, municipality, province or territory if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.

Dispute Notice. In the event of a Dispute, you or JavaScriptLA, LLC must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the “Dispute Notice”).

The Dispute Notice to JavaScriptLA, LLC must be addressed to: JavaScriptLA, LLC, 2601 E Ocean Blvd #302 Long Beach, CA 90803 U.S.A., Attn: JavaScriptLA, LLC (the “JavaScriptLA, LLC Notice Address”). The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. If JavaScriptLA, LLC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or JavaScriptLA, LLC may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.

WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND JavaScriptLA, LLC AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL, STATE OR PROVINCIAL CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY’S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU AND JavaScriptLA, LLC AGREE THAT NO DISPUTE SHALL PROCEED BY WAY OF CLASS ARBITRATION WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES.

Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by: in the U.S., the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “JAMS Rules”), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in these Terms; except that JAMS, as applicable, may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules, as applicable, and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, provincial, territorial, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, provincial, territorial or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court shall determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of “Disputes” as stated above. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in the U.S. in Los Angeles County, California, at your option.

Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or JavaScriptLA, LLC decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:

Write a Demand or Notice:
If in the U.S., write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.jamsadr.com (“Demand for Arbitration”).

In the U.S.:

JAMS

707 Wilshire Blvd

46th Floor

Los Angeles, CA 90017, U.S.A.

Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration or Notice to Arbitrate to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.

Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by JavaScriptLA, LLC or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or JavaScriptLA, LLC is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.

Arbitration Fees. JavaScriptLA, LLC shall pay, or (if applicable) reimburse you for, all JAMS (as applicable) filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration commenced (by you or JavaScriptLA, LLC) pursuant to provisions of these Terms. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.

Opt-out. You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in these Terms by sending a written letter to the JavaScriptLA, LLC Notice Address within thirty (30) days of your initial assent to these Terms (including your first purchase of any JavaScriptLA, LLC Service or use of our websites) that specifies: (i) your name; (ii) your mailing address; and (iii) your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Section. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall continue to apply.

Amendments to this Section. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and JavaScriptLA, LLC agree that if JavaScriptLA, LLC makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to JavaScriptLA, LLC’s address) in these Terms, JavaScriptLA, LLC will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments by sending a written letter to the JavaScriptLA, LLC Notice Address within thirty (30) days of JavaScriptLA, LLC’s notification that specifies: (i) your name; (ii) your mailing address; and (iii) your request to opt-out of such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.

Severability. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.

Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies. JavaScriptLA, LLC and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, or the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.

## Indemnification; Limitation of Liability.

Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold JavaScriptLA, LLC, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers harmless from and against any claim, action, demand, loss, suit, or damages (including attorneys' fees) made or incurred by any third party arising out of or relating to your improper use of any JavaScriptLA, LLC Services, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party.

Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL JavaScriptLA, LLC, JavaScriptLA, LLC, LLC, TEAM JavaScriptLA, LLC CANADA LP, OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES OR PARENT COMPANIES, OR ANY OF THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, COMPENSATORY, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, LOSS OF PRIVACY, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORESEEABILITY AND/OR IF WE WERE ADVISED OF SUCH DAMAGES OR OF ANY ADVICE OR NOTICE GIVEN TO JavaScriptLA, LLC OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF ANY JavaScriptLA, LLC SERVICES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF JavaScriptLA, LLC AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS TO YOU UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU IN THE LAST NINETY (90) DAYS TO JavaScriptLA, LLC FOR ANY JavaScriptLA, LLC SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN JavaScriptLA, LLC AND YOU. THE JavaScriptLA, LLC SERVICES WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. JavaScriptLA, LLC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THESE TERMS IF SUCH FAILURE IS CAUSED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET OUTAGES, COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES, FIRE, FLOOD, NATURAL DISASTER, CIVIL UNREST OR WAR.
