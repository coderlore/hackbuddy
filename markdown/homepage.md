## Level Up Your Software Engineering

HackBuddy.com is a software engineering community with over 4,000 members, dedicated to helping you become a better software engineer.

We meet monthly (or sometimes more) to talk about technologies and skills for anyone learning web and app development, finding employment, as well leveling up to go to the next stage of their career.

### Join Us From Anywhere in the World

We are now 100% REMOTE ONLINE, so no need to drive long distance to find us anymore. We use the latest in remote technology so you can communicate with us no matter where you are in the world (e.g. Zoom, Google Meets, Github, YouTube).

## Become A Better Software Engineer

We want YOU to become a better software engineer. Our founder, Vijay believes this is HackBuddy's greatest mission (as he himself also the group's biggest customer).

Programming is hard, 100%. It's easy to get lost studying random tutorials, attending various meetups and spend boatloads of money hoping some bootcamp or weekend course is finally going to get you the payoff or life you deserve.

Our mission is to help sort through all the tutorials, bootcamps, meetups, books, videos, courses, and help give you a focused roadmap that you can take to become successful.

We've already helped tons of people meet their goals, including landing job at the coveted FAANG businesses. Vijay, himself has met his goal of becoming a top notch software engineer and doubling his own salary over years of organizing the meetup, and is on track to do bigger and brighter things year over year; this year working at one of the world's leading fitness companies and helping them architect a path forward towards becoming a better technology focused company.

## Take Advantage Of The Community

We've got connections to some of the best companies in the business. We know how it feels to apply over and over endlessly to 1000s of companies with no response. Hang out with us instead and learn directly from the engineers that work on the projects YOU want to work on some day; and carve out your next steps.

Even if you don't get the job right now, you can learn from people who already work in the field you want (e.g. frontend, backend, devops, fullstack) with the language/technology you want (JavaScript, PHP, Go, Ruby on Rails, Java, C#, SQL/NOSQL, Blockchain, etc).

Build your network of contacts with us -- as they say, it's not what you know, it's WHO YOU KNOW that gets you that next job! So bring your best programming game to us, and we'll help you network with the best!
