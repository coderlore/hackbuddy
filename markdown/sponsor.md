# Sponsor Us

## Are you a company looking to get involved with our group?

We are a perfect group to sponsor for any company or school that wishes to attract more talent or candidates especially for classes, workshops, trainings and job offers. Build your list and presence with this group for way less than what it costs to advertise on popular Social Media Platforms (e.g. Big Tech), and the great thing is you’ll reach real people (not robots and fake profiles)!

If you want to become a sponsor of our group, simply contact us via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net). Please ask about Sponsorships in the subject line.

## Are you an individual wishing to make a donation or sponsorship?

We are also funded by our community members — support the group by getting a T-shirt! You’ll look great wearing it and we’ll make great content with your money! A total win-win!

You can also sponsor us by writing to us directly by email and asking about sponsorship information via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net). Your contributions help us improve the overall website, bring in better content, higher quality production value and more — so the money comes back to you; fund us so we can further improve your programming skills! Again a 360 win!

## Are you a non-profit entity or charity wishing to get exposure for an upcoming event?

That’s really great! We love helping for good causes, and would be glad to get you some exposure. Please be sure to submit information about your non-profit or charity entity, including information about your event/cause via [info@javascriptla.net](mailto:info@javascriptla.net), and we will get in touch with you as soon as we can.
